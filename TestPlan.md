# System-Level Requirements for PizzaDronz Service

## Functional Requirements
1. **Order Management**
   - Accept orders from a REST API endpoint and parse them into a structured format.
   - Filter out invalid orders based on criteria such as:
     - Incorrect credit card details.
     - Expired credit cards or invalid CVV.
     - Invalid pizza combinations (e.g., items from multiple restaurants in one order).

2. **Flight Path Calculation**
   - Calculate the shortest valid path to deliver pizzas while avoiding no-fly zones.
   - Ensure the drone returns to Appleton Tower before battery depletion.
   - Prevent re-entry into the Central Area after exiting it during delivery.

3. **No-Fly Zone Compliance**
   - Avoid entering or passing through predefined no-fly zones using GeoJSON data.

4. **Delivery Execution**
   - Deliver pizzas by hovering at the restaurant and drop-off points for one move each.
   - Ensure accurate location proximity during pickup and delivery (within 0.00015 degrees).

5. **Dynamic Data Handling**
   - Retrieve and process dynamic data (e.g., orders, restaurants, no-fly zones) from the REST service at runtime.

6. **Error Handling**
   - Handle invalid REST responses gracefully, including retry mechanisms.

## Measurable Quality Attributes
1. **Performance**
   - Maximum runtime: 60 seconds per session to calculate the dayâ€™s deliveries and flight paths.
   - Process at least 100 valid orders within a single drone operation cycle.

2. **Accuracy**
   - Maintain delivery location accuracy within a tolerance of 0.00015 degrees.
   - Ensure no overlap with no-fly zones during flight path execution.

3. **Reliability**
   - Achieve a minimum success rate of 95% for delivering valid orders.

4. **Battery Efficiency**
   - Limit drone moves to 2000 per session to conserve battery life.
   - Optimize flight paths to minimize energy consumption.

5. **Scalability**
   - Handle peak loads of up to 200 orders per day without performance degradation.

## Qualitative Requirements
1. **Usability**
   - Provide clear error messages for invalid input data.
   - Ensure all outputs (e.g., flight paths, deliveries) are recorded in readable JSON and GeoJSON formats.

2. **Security**
   - Do not store sensitive customer data (e.g., credit card details) persistently.
   - Validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks.

3. **Maintainability**
   - Use Java 18 features like streams, records, and pattern matching for clean, modern code.
   - Document code thoroughly using JavaDoc for ease of future development.

4. **Extensibility**
   - Ensure the solution is adaptable to new restaurants or delivery points by relying on dynamic data.

## Additional Requirements
1. **Compliance**
   - Adhere to all constraints specified in the coursework, such as REST API formatting and GeoJSON standards.
   - Meet all naming conventions for files and output formats.

2. **Visualization**
   - Generate GeoJSON flight path files for easy visualization and debugging of drone movements.

3. **Reproducibility**
   - Use a single, seed-based pseudo-random number generator to ensure consistent results across executions.

4. **Logging**
   - Provide diagnostic logs for debugging, but ensure these are concise and non-intrusive.
