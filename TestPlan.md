# Section 1: System-Level Requirements for PizzaDronz Service

## Functional Requirements
1. **Order Management**
   - Accept orders from a REST API endpoint and parse them into a structured format.
   - Filter out invalid orders based on criteria such as:
     - Incorrect credit card details.
     - Expired credit cards or invalid CVV.
     - Invalid pizza combinations (e.g., items from multiple restaurants in one order).

2. **Flight Path Calculation**
   - Calculate the shortest valid path to deliver pizzas while avoiding no-fly zones.
   - Ensure the drone returns to Appleton Tower before battery depletion.
   - Prevent re-entry into the Central Area after exiting it during delivery.

3. **No-Fly Zone Compliance**
   - Avoid entering or passing through predefined no-fly zones using GeoJSON data.

4. **Delivery Execution**
   - Deliver pizzas by hovering at the restaurant and drop-off points for one move each.
   - Ensure accurate location proximity during pickup and delivery (within 0.00015 degrees).

5. **Dynamic Data Handling**
   - Retrieve and process dynamic data (e.g., orders, restaurants, no-fly zones) from the REST service at runtime.

6. **Error Handling**
   - Handle invalid REST responses gracefully, including retry mechanisms.

## Measurable Quality Attributes
1. **Performance**
   - Maximum runtime: 60 seconds per session to calculate the dayâ€™s deliveries and flight paths.
   - Process at least 100 valid orders within a single drone operation cycle.

2. **Accuracy**
   - Maintain delivery location accuracy within a tolerance of 0.00015 degrees.
   - Ensure no overlap with no-fly zones during flight path execution.

3. **Reliability**
   - Achieve a minimum success rate of 95% for delivering valid orders.

4. **Battery Efficiency**
   - Limit drone moves to 2000 per session to conserve battery life.
   - Optimize flight paths to minimize energy consumption.

5. **Scalability**
   - Handle peak loads of up to 200 orders per day without performance degradation.

## Qualitative Requirements
1. **Usability**
   - Provide clear error messages for invalid input data.
   - Ensure all outputs (e.g., flight paths, deliveries) are recorded in readable JSON and GeoJSON formats.

2. **Security**
   - Do not store sensitive customer data (e.g., credit card details) persistently.
   - Validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks.

3. **Maintainability**
   - Use Java 18 features like streams, records, and pattern matching for clean, modern code.
   - Document code thoroughly using JavaDoc for ease of future development.

4. **Extensibility**
   - Ensure the solution is adaptable to new restaurants or delivery points by relying on dynamic data.

## Additional Requirements
1. **Compliance**
   - Adhere to all constraints specified in the coursework, such as REST API formatting and GeoJSON standards.
   - Meet all naming conventions for files and output formats.

2. **Visualization**
   - Generate GeoJSON flight path files for easy visualization and debugging of drone movements.

3. **Reproducibility**
   - Use a single, seed-based pseudo-random number generator to ensure consistent results across executions.

4. **Logging**
   - Provide diagnostic logs for debugging, but ensure these are concise and non-intrusive.

# Section 3: Appropriateness of Chosen Test Approach
The chosen testing approaches comprehensively address the requirements of the PizzaDronz project but also have identifiable limitations. System-level tests, such as load testing and runtime performance benchmarking, are appropriate for assessing high-level functionality and efficiency under stress conditions. However, they may overlook intermittent edge cases that could arise in rare operational scenarios. Integration tests ensure seamless communication between modules, including validation of REST API interactions and proper deserialization of external data. While effective, these tests assume correct implementation of external services and may not account for unexpected behaviors from those sources. Unit tests, including mutation testing for robustness, provide precise validation of core functionalities like geographic calculations and order validations but may lack the ability to detect larger systemic issues arising from module interactions.

Despite these potential deficiencies, the overall approach aligns well with project requirements. For example, fuzz testing in system-level tests mitigates risks of malformed inputs, and mock testing in integration tests addresses API reliability concerns. However, additional exploratory testing, such as chaos testing to simulate unexpected failures, could enhance robustness further. The test plan provides a solid foundation for quality assurance, detailed fully in the table above.
