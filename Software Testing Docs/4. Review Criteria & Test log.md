# Review Process & Criteria

To ensure code quality and maintain consistency, a rigorous review process was followed before merging new features. The review process began with the automatic execution of the linter, **Language Support for Java by Red Hat**, upon any file changes. This linter ensured adherence to the Google Java style guide, maintaining a consistent codebase format and reducing potential formatting-related issues. Any violations flagged by the linter were resolved before proceeding to the next steps of the review.

In addition to automated checks, regular code inspections were conducted throughout the testing and development process. These inspections aimed to identify logic errors, inefficiencies, or potential edge cases that might have been overlooked during implementation. A log of all identified issues was maintained and managed through Jira, where issues were tracked, prioritised, and resolved systematically. This review process not only ensured high-quality code but also contributed to a well-documented testing and debugging workflow. Please refer to the section below for a comprehensive list of issues identified and their resolutions.

# Issues identified after reviews

This section logs issues discovered through code reviews or automated testing.

- **Singleton Reset**: AreaSingleton had no way to reset the instance - fixed by adding a `tearDown()` function.
- **GeoJSON Formatting**: Output wasn't strictly following the GeoJSON format, as it had incorrect whitespace - fixed by modifying the FileWriter.java file.
- **Input Validation**: Multiple classes accepted null parameters being passed in - fixed by adding input validation to the majority of constructors.
- **Order Validation**: Passing a non-numerical date into the credit card expiry caused the program to crash without a clear error message - fixed by adding more checks in Order validations.
- **Luhn's Algorithm**: Luhn's algorithm was slightly incorrectly implemented - passed most cases but failed on some edge cases.
- **Invalid Coordinates**: Multiple points in the code where longitude and latitude could be outside of acceptable ranges (e.g., latitude of 500).
- **REST API Exceptions**: Exceptions were not being caught upon invalid connection attempts to the REST API endpoint.
- **Date Validation**: Incorrect algorithm for verifying the date of an order after the REST API was updated.
- **Flightpath Validation**: Flightpath contained invalid angles of movement, using the direction of parent from child instead of child from parent - fixed by correcting the movement vector calculation.
- **Credit Card Validation**: Expiry date checks failed to validate against current dates when the input date was malformed.
- **Output Files**: Incorrect titles for output files were inconsistent with specification - fixed by standardising file naming conventions.
- **Pathfinding Edge Cases**: Pathfinding failed in scenarios where two points were separated by dense no-fly zones - fixed by refining heuristic calculations.
- **Unhandled Exceptions**: System tests identified unhandled exceptions during integration, especially for invalid REST responses - fixed by adding exception handling and retry mechanisms.
- **GeoJSON Website Compatibility**: Generated GeoJSON files were incompatible with the GeoJSON website due to minor format errors - fixed by stricter adherence to GeoJSON standards.

# Tracking Issues

Jira was extensively utilised to track, manage, and prioritise issues throughout the project. Each identified issue was logged as a ticket in Jira, detailing the problem, its context, and steps for resolution. Tickets were assigned a priority level ranging from "Low" to "Critical" to ensure that the most impactful issues, such as failures in the pathfinding algorithm or REST API exceptions, were addressed promptly. Point estimates were also assigned to each ticket based on the expected time and effort required for resolution, enabling better sprint planning and workload distribution.

The use of Jira's Kanban board streamlined the tracking process, providing a clear visualisation of tasks in their respective stages: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". This allowed for effective monitoring of progress and ensured accountability for each task. The ability to link tickets to specific features or tests also enhanced traceability, making it easier to verify that fixes were adequately tested before being closed. Overall, Jira provided an organised and efficient framework for managing issues, ensuring that critical problems were resolved promptly while maintaining high project quality.
