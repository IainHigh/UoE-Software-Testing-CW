# Section 1: Construction of CI Pipeline

The PizzaDronz project used Git as the version control system, with the repository hosted on GitHub. Unlike traditional feature-branch workflows, we opted to commit directly to the main branch. This decision was justified by the simplicity of the project and the limited scope of development. By ensuring rigorous testing through automated CI pipelines, the risk of directly committing to the main branch was mitigated.

The CI pipeline was implemented using GitHub Actions, which integrated seamlessly with our GitHub repository to provide robust automation for building and testing the project.

The primary purpose of the CI pipeline was to:

- Build the project to verify it compiles successfully.
- Execute unit, integration, and system tests to ensure correctness.

The CI pipeline was constructed as a YAML workflow file (`maven.yml`) in the repository. It is triggered automatically on every push or pull request to the main branch. This ensures that any code changes meet the required quality standards before being incorporated into the project.

The complete YAML file for the pipeline can be accessed [here](https://github.com/IainHigh/UoE-Software-Testing-CW/blob/master/.github/workflows/maven.yml).

# Section 2: Automated Testing

The CI pipeline automates the testing process at three levels:

1. **Unit Tests**:

   - Verifies the correctness of individual modules.
   - Ensures compliance with functional requirements such as pathfinding and order sorting.

2. **Integration Tests**:

   - Validates the interaction between different modules (e.g., drone navigation and order management).
   - Confirms that data flows seamlessly through the system.

3. **System Tests**:
   - Evaluates the software as a whole to ensure end-to-end functionality.
   - Simulates real-world scenarios by running the system on representative datasets.

All tests are run each time a change is committed to the repo, this means that any change that could potentially cause an error is caught quickly and ensures confidence in the codebase.

# Section 3: Functionality of the CI Pipeline

The CI pipeline functions as expected, ensuring continuous validation of the codebase. Upon a push or pull request, the pipeline:

- Builds the project.
- Executes all levels of tests.
- Blocks commits that fail any stage of the pipeline, thereby maintaining code quality.

A video demonstrating the pipeline in action has been recorded and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/IainHigh/UoE-Software-Testing-CW/blob/master/Software%20Testing%20Docs/CI%20Pipeline.mp4).
