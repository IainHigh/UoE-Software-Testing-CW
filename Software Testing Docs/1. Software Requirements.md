# Section 1: Introduction

## 1.1: Purpose Statement

The purpose of this project is to develop an automated pizza drone delivery service for the University of Edinburgh. The service will employ a single autonomous drone that begins and ends its operations at Appleton Tower each day. The drone will retrieve daily order information from a REST API and plan optimal routes to fulfil these orders one at a time. The service aims to facilitate convenient pizza delivery from local restaurants to students and staff, enhancing accessibility and efficiency.

The drone's navigation system will prioritise safety and privacy. It will strictly avoid designated no-fly zones, particularly in areas heavily populated to minimise risks. Additionally, to respect privacy, the drone will not be equipped with cameras or other surveillance technologies. The system will incorporate advanced route calculation algorithms, ensuring timely deliveries while adhering to operational constraints such as restaurant availability, credit card validations, and battery limitations.

## 1.2: Intended Audience

The primary audience for the Pizza Drone Delivery Service includes students and staff members at the University of Edinburgh. This service is designed to meet the needs of a diverse university community, providing a convenient and efficient way to access meals during busy schedules. Whether it's a late-night study session or a quick lunch break, the service aims to cater to individuals who value reliable, fast, and accessible food delivery options. By focusing on safety, privacy, and operational efficiency, the system aligns with the unique requirements of a university environment. Additionally, the service has been developed with consideration for the broader campus community, ensuring minimal disruption to daily activities while maintaining high standards of safety and user satisfaction.

## 1.3: Intended Use

The pizza drone delivery service is designed to operate as a fully autonomous system, managing all aspects of flight and delivery without human intervention. The system will autonomously retrieve the order data from a REST API, plan efficient routes to nearby participating restaurants, and deliver the orders to Appleton Tower. The drone will be equipped to handle route adjustments to account for no-fly zones and delivery priorities. This service is intended to provide a seamless, user-friendly experience while ensuring operational efficiency and safety on the University of Edinburgh campus.

## 1.4: Scope

The primary objective of this project is to provide a fast and efficient solution for students and staff at the University of Edinburgh to receive meals without the need to wait in long queues or rely on traditional delivery services. By leveraging the autonomous capabilities of the drone, this system will significantly reduce delivery times by eliminating delays caused by traffic laws and road congestion, offering a convenient and modern alternative to traditional delivery methods.

Additionally, this system aims to promote sustainability by reducing the reliance on deliveries made by cars and motorbikes, which contribute to air pollution and traffic congestion. By opting for a drone-based delivery model, the university can help decrease carbon emissions and improve air quality around the campus. This innovative service not only enhances user convenience but also aligns with broader environmental goals, making it a valuable addition to the university's infrastructure.

# Section 2: System Features and Requirements

## 2.1: System Modules

The system will be divided into the following modules/packages:

### **OrderInformation**

- Handles the representation and validation of orders.
- Includes classes such as:
  - `Order`: Represents an individual order and validates its details, including credit card information and pizzas ordered.
  - `Pizza`: Represents a pizza, including its name and price.
  - `CreditCardInformation`: Validates credit card details, including number, CVV, and expiry date.
  - `Restaurant`: Represents a restaurant, including its menu and location.
  - `OrderRetriever`: Retrieves and deserializes order and restaurant data from the REST API.
  - `Menu`: Represents a restaurant menu item.

### **RouteCalculation**

- Manages route planning and navigation for the drone using the A\* search algorithm.
- Includes classes such as:
  - `RouteCalculator`: Calculates the shortest route for the drone, avoiding no-fly zones and staying within the central area.

# Section 3: Testing Approaches

## 3.1: General Approach

This project follows a bottom-up testing approach, beginning with rigorous unit testing for all lower-level modules and progressively moving toward integration, system, and acceptance testing. Each module was independently tested, and integration tests were conducted to validate interactions between modules. Finally, system tests were implemented to ensure the overall functionality of the drone delivery system. The goal was to achieve high test coverage and confidence in the reliability of the system.

## 3.2: Test Server

The REST service used for this project provides representative test data, including information on restaurants, orders, and no-fly zones. This data has been instrumental in validating both individual components and the overall system. Additional custom test cases were also generated to simulate edge cases and more complex scenarios.

## 3.3: Formal Proofs of Algorithms

Testing pathfinding algorithms like A* exhaustively for every possible scenario is impractical. Instead, the correctness of the algorithm was validated using formal proofs to ensure the pathfinding is optimal. By definition, the A* algorithm guarantees an optimal solution when the heuristic is admissible and consistent [1]. For this project, the heuristic was designed to comply with these properties, with formal justification provided [2]. Where feasible, component and integration tests were used to verify the correctness and optimality of the pathfinding implementation.

## 3.4: Manual Inspection

While automated tests cover most components of this project, certain aspects, such as the content of exported flight paths and order outcomes, require manual inspection. These include reviewing GeoJSON and JSON outputs for consistency, accuracy, and adherence to project specifications. This approach ensures a baseline confidence level in the final deliverables.

## 3.5: System Test Isolation

To handle memory and resource constraints during system testing, measures were implemented to ensure all tests ran independently without interference. The testing framework was configured to clear heap memory between tests and allocate sufficient resources, enabling reliable execution of large-scale system tests.

# Section 4: Appropriateness of Test Approach

The chosen testing approach is well-suited to the requirements of the PizzaDronz project, leveraging a bottom-up methodology to ensure a high level of confidence in the system's reliability. Starting with unit testing, we ensured that core functionalities, such as pathfinding, order validation, and geographic calculations, were rigorously validated at the component level. This provided a solid foundation for the subsequent integration testing, minimizing the likelihood of encountering fundamental bugs when validating interactions between modules. For instance, the integration tests ensured seamless communication between modules like `OrderInformation` and `RouteCalculation`, while accounting for REST API interactions and deserialization processes.

Integration testing was critical in validating that the independently tested modules worked together cohesively. The use of mock testing for REST API endpoints and custom test cases to simulate edge scenarios further enhanced the robustness of the system. By systematically testing modules in isolation and then as a whole, we addressed the risk of interface mismatches and ensured consistent behaviour across the system. Furthermore, by conducting system-level tests under realistic scenarios, such as delivering multiple orders across various dates, we verified the end-to-end functionality of the drone delivery system, including adherence to time constraints and accurate generation of output files.

One of the key strengths of this approach is its adaptability to the project’s dynamic requirements. System tests evaluated overall performance and memory usage, providing insights into runtime efficiency and ensuring the program meets its 60-second runtime constraint. Additionally, measures like a manual inspection for exported files and seed-based random number generation for reproducibility addressed specific project needs while mitigating risks associated with edge cases and intermittent failures.

Overall, the testing strategy balances thoroughness and practicality, focusing on rigorous component validation, seamless integration, and robust system evaluation. While the approach is comprehensive, it remains efficient, allowing the identification and resolution of errors at all levels of development. This ensures that the final product meets the quality and performance expectations defined in the requirements while remaining adaptable for future enhancements or changes.
