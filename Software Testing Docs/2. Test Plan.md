# Section 1: Overview

The PizzaDronz project followed a waterfall development methodology rather than a test-driven development (TDD) approach due to the project originally being completed two years ago. Consequently, the test plan was constructed post-development and aligned to validate existing functionalities rather than evolve in tandem with iterative development. However, due to the requirement for detailed documentation to be produced for this coursework - a waterfall method aligns more closely than an agile approach where minimal documentation is preferred.

# Section 2: Requirement Priorities and Prerequisites

Below is an assessment of each key requirement, considering its priority, importance, dependencies, and the steps required for validation and verification (V&V). Please refer to the following guide for the meaning of each level of importance:

- Critical Importance: Essential to the viability of the software, specifically requested by the University of Edinburgh.
- High Importance: Not essential to the viability of the software, can function without this requirement being checked but will have large impact on the overall quality of the product.
- Medium Importance: Important for usability and efficiency but not crucial for core functionality.
- Low Importance: Unlikely to have any impact on the stakeholders.

There are five main requirements we will consider. There are many more requirements but due to time constraints only requirements with critical or high importance will be analysed here.

- R1: The drone should never fly through a no-fly zone
- R2: Pathfinding should filter out all invalid nodes
- R3: The drone should always find a route starting from Appleton Tower and finishing "chose to" the Restaurant. Vice versa for the return route.
- R4: Pathfinding will always find a route from point A to point B if one exists.
- R5: Orders should be in ascending order of restaurant distance to Appleton Tower.

## R1: The drone should never fly through a no-fly zone

The delivery drone should never enter a no-fly zone. This is for the safety of students, staff and any member of public on campus as these zones are heavily populated areas such as George Square.Since this requirement determines the viability of the service and has been specifically requested by a key stakeholder, it has been classifie as as a requirement of **critical importance**. This implies that a lot of effort should be spent in ensuring this requirement is met.

### Decomposition

To validate and verify this requirement, we decompose it into smaller sub-requirements:

- **R1.1**: The drone’s flight path between two points should not contain any points that intersect with no-fly zones.
- **R2**: The pathfinding algorithm should exclude all invalid nodes when evaluating neighbouring nodes. Invalid nodes are defined as:
  - Nodes within a no-fly zone.
  - Nodes that cause the drone to leave the central area while carrying a pizza.

The partition principle helps simplify the problem by focusing on ensuring that neighbouring nodes are correctly filtered.

### Validation and Verification

#### R1.1: Flight paths do not contain points in no-fly zones

- **Validation**: Generate test datasets of points near no-fly zones and validate that the paths produced by the algorithm do not intersect with no-fly zones.
- **Verification**: For each generated path, iterate through its points and confirm that none fall within the boundaries of a no-fly zone.

#### R2: Pathfinding algorithm filters invalid nodes

- **Validation**: Use scaffolding to mock the pathfinding algorithm's neighbour selection and ensure only valid nodes are considered.
- **Verification**: Test scenarios such as:
  - A point entirely within a no-fly zone should have no valid neighbours.
  - A point at the boundary of a no-fly zone should exclude neighbouring points within the no-fly zone.
  - A point outside the central area (while the drone is carrying a pizza) should correctly filter invalid neighbours.

### Testing Tasks

To ensure R1 is met, the following tasks are required:

1. **Generate test data**:
   - Create datasets with points near no-fly zones.
   - Include random points inside, at the boundary of, and outside no-fly zones.
2. **Mock pathfinding behaviour**:
   - Develop scaffolding to simulate the pathfinding algorithm's neighbour selection.
   - Use scaffolding to force various scenarios for validation and verification.
3. **Iterative path verification**:
   - Check all paths generated during integration tests to ensure they comply with R1.1.
4. **Edge case analysis**:
   - Include cases such as:
     - Routes that begin or end at the boundary of no-fly zones.
     - Routes that involve densely packed no-fly zones.

## R2: Pathfinding should filter out all invalid nodes

When evaluating neighbouring nodes during pathfinding, the algorithm must filter out all invalid nodes. Invalid nodes are defined as:

- Nodes that are within a no-fly zone.
- Nodes that cause the drone to leave the central area while carrying a pizza.

This requirement directly impacts the drone's ability to navigate safely and efficiently. Failure to meet this requirement could lead to violations of other critical requirements, such as avoiding no-fly zones and ensuring safe operations within the central area. Therefore, this requirement has been classified as **critical importance** and requires thorough validation and verification.

### Decomposition

To validate and verify this requirement, we decompose it into smaller sub-requirements:

- **R2.1**: The pathfinding algorithm must exclude all neighbouring nodes that are within a no-fly zone.
- **R2.2**: The pathfinding algorithm must exclude nodes that cause the drone to leave the central area while carrying a pizza.

### Validation and Verification

#### R2.1: Exclude nodes in no-fly zones

- **Validation**: Develop test datasets with points near, inside, and at the boundaries of no-fly zones. Validate that the algorithm correctly excludes invalid nodes.
- **Verification**: Mock the pathfinding behaviour and ensure no invalid nodes are included in the neighbour evaluation. Specific scenarios include:
  - A node fully within a no-fly zone should have no valid neighbours.
  - Nodes at the boundary of no-fly zones must exclude any neighbours within the no-fly zone.

#### R2.2: Exclude nodes that cause the drone to leave the central area while carrying a pizza

- **Validation**: Simulate scenarios where the drone is carrying a pizza and validate that nodes outside the central area are excluded.
- **Verification**: Check specific cases such as:
  - A node at the boundary of the central area should not allow neighbours outside the area if the drone is carrying a pizza.
  - Nodes within the central area should allow all valid neighbours if the drone is not carrying a pizza.

### Testing Tasks

To ensure R2 is met, the following tasks are required:

1. **Generate test data**:
   - Create datasets of nodes in and around no-fly zones and the central area boundary.
   - Include cases where the drone is carrying a pizza and cases where it is not.
2. **Mock pathfinding behaviour**:
   - Implement scaffolding to simulate the neighbour filtering behaviour of the pathfinding algorithm.
   - Use scaffolding to force values for whether the drone is carrying a pizza or not.
3. **Iterative node evaluation**:
   - Verify that neighbouring nodes are correctly filtered in all scenarios:
     - Nodes within no-fly zones are excluded.
     - Nodes outside the central area are excluded when carrying a pizza.
4. **Edge case analysis**:
   - Test scenarios such as:
     - A node at the exact boundary of a no-fly zone.
     - A node at the boundary of the central area while the drone is carrying a pizza.
     - Nodes in densely packed no-fly zones or along complex boundaries.

## R3: The drone should always find a route starting from Appleton Tower and finishing “close to” the Restaurant

The delivery drone must reliably calculate a route from Appleton Tower to a restaurant if such a route exists. The term “close to” is defined in the Software Requirements Specification as within 0.00015 degrees of the destination point. This requirement ensures the validity and functionality of the pathfinding algorithm, making it an integration requirement of **critical importance**. Significant resources must be dedicated to validating and verifying this requirement to guarantee system reliability.

### Decomposition

To validate and verify this requirement, we decompose it into smaller sub-requirements:

- **R3.1**: The drone should always find a route from Appleton Tower to a restaurant if a route exists.
- **R3.2**: The pathfinding algorithm should find a valid route between any two points (A and B) if a route exists.

### Validation and Verification

#### R3.1: Route from Appleton Tower to a restaurant

- **Validation**: Create test cases for scenarios where a restaurant is reachable from Appleton Tower. Validate that the route ends within 0.00015 degrees of the restaurant.
- **Verification**: Build scaffolding to represent an order to a restaurant. Verify the pathfinding algorithm calculates a valid route to the restaurant.

#### R3.2: Valid route between any two points

- **Validation**: Generate a variety of test cases, including:
  - Points within the central area.
  - Points separated by no-fly zones.
  - Points at the boundary of the central area.
- **Verification**: Ensure the pathfinding algorithm finds a route between the two points in all scenarios where a route exists. Specific checks include:
  - The first node in the route is the starting point.
  - The last node in the route is within 0.00015 degrees of the destination.
  - For cases where the start and end points are the same, the route should be empty.

### Testing Tasks

To ensure R3 is met, the following tasks are required:

1. **Generate test data**:
   - Create scenarios involving restaurants at various locations, including near no-fly zones and at the edges of the central area.

   - Mock data inputs to test pathfinding behaviour for various restaurant locations.
3. **Iterative path validation**:
   - Ensure all generated paths start at Appleton Tower and end within 0.00015 degrees of the restaurant.
   - Check that the pathfinding algorithm finds no route in scenarios where no valid route exists.
4. **Edge case analysis**:
   - Test paths where:
     - The start and end points are identical.
     - A direct route is blocked by a no-fly zone.
     - The route requires navigating multiple no-fly zones.

## R4: Pathfinding will always find a route from point A to point B if one exists

The pathfinding algorithm must reliably calculate a valid route between any two points (A and B) if such a route exists. This requirement ensures the core functionality of the algorithm, guaranteeing that the system can navigate complex environments effectively. **Critical Importance**

### Decomposition

To validate and verify this requirement, we decompose it into smaller sub-requirements:

- **R4.1**: The pathfinding algorithm should calculate a valid route from point A to point B if a path exists.
- **R4.2**: The pathfinding algorithm should return an empty route when the start and end points are the same.

### Validation and Verification

#### R4.1: Valid route between two distinct points

- **Validation**: Create test datasets that include:
  - Points within the central area.
  - Points separated by no-fly zones.
  - Points at or near the boundary of the central area.
- **Verification**: For each route generated:
  - Ensure the first node corresponds to the starting point (A).
  - Confirm the last node is within 0.00015 degrees of the destination (B).
  - Verify that the path contains no invalid nodes, such as points within no-fly zones.

#### R4.2: Empty route for identical start and end points

- **Validation**: Generate test cases where the start and end points are the same.
- **Verification**: Confirm the path returned by the algorithm is empty.

3. **Edge case analysis**:
   - Test scenarios such as:
     - A direct path blocked by no-fly zones.
     - Routes with densely packed obstacles.
     - Identical start and end points.

## R5: Orders should be in ascending order of restaurant distance to Appleton Tower

The delivery drone must prioritise orders by delivering to restaurants closest to Appleton Tower first. This optimises the number of deliveries completed in a single battery cycle, ensuring efficient operation. **High Importance**

### Decomposition

To validate and verify this requirement, we decompose it into a single sub-requirement:

- **R5.1**: Orders must be sorted in ascending order of the restaurant's distance to Appleton Tower before delivery.

### Validation and Verification

#### R5.1: Orders sorted by distance

- **Validation**: Create a dataset of orders with varying restaurant distances from Appleton Tower.
- **Verification**: Ensure that the orders are sorted in ascending order of restaurant distance:
  - Compare the sequence of orders after sorting with the expected order.
  - Validate correctness for edge cases, such as:
    - Multiple orders from restaurants equidistant from Appleton Tower.
    - Orders from a single restaurant.

### Testing Tasks

To ensure R5 is met, the following tasks are required:

1. **Generate test data**:
   - Create datasets with:
     - Restaurants at various distances from Appleton Tower.
     - Multiple orders from the same restaurant.

     - Only one order present in the dataset.
     - Randomised input sequences.

# Section 3: Scaffolding and Instrumentation

To validate and verify the requirements outlined, several scaffolding and instrumentation tasks need to be implemented. Below, the specific scaffolding and instrumentation necessary for each requirement is detailed.

## R1: The drone should never fly through a no-fly zone

- **Test Data Generation**:
  - Create datasets of points near, inside, and at the boundaries of no-fly zones.
  - Generate random points distributed across Edinburgh for broader testing.
- **Pathfinding Scaffolding**:
  - Develop scaffolding to simulate the pathfinding algorithm's behaviour.
  - Ensure scaffolding allows for detailed observability of the drone's route calculations.
- **Validation and Verification**:
  - Use scaffolding to force specific edge cases, such as densely packed no-fly zones and points at boundaries.
  - Enable automated checks to verify that no generated route intersects with no-fly zones.

## R2: Pathfinding should filter out all invalid neighbouring nodes

- **Mock Neighbour Selection**:
  - Build scaffolding to mock the neighbour selection process within the pathfinding algorithm.
  - Allow for configurable inputs to simulate various scenarios, such as the drone carrying a pizza.
- **Data Preparation**:
  - Generate test datasets with points inside, near, and outside no-fly zones, as well as near the boundaries of the central area.
- **Scenario Simulation**:
  - Use scaffolding to simulate the behaviour of the algorithm when filtering nodes.
  - Implement forced scenarios where invalid nodes must be excluded correctly, such as points entirely within no-fly zones.

## R3: The drone should always find a route starting from Appleton Tower and finishing “close to” the Restaurant

- **Order Scaffolding**:
  - Create scaffolding to simulate a variety of orders, ensuring restaurant locations span across Edinburgh and include edge cases (e.g., near no-fly zones).
  - Enable validation of the final node in the route to be within 0.00015 degrees of the restaurant.
- **Pathfinding Simulation**:
  - Build scaffolding to simulate pathfinding from Appleton Tower to various restaurant locations.
  - Mock scenarios with blocked paths to ensure the algorithm handles obstacles correctly.
- **Data Handling**:
  - Include datasets with obstacles like no-fly zones to test how the algorithm adapts in complex environments.

## R4: Pathfinding will always find a route from point A to point B if one exists

- **Synthetic Test Data**:
  - Develop datasets with various configurations, including:
    - Points in the central area.
    - Points separated by no-fly zones or at boundaries.
    - Identical start and end points for empty route testing.
- **Mock Pathfinding**:
  - Build scaffolding to validate pathfinding output for various scenarios.
  - Ensure the algorithm produces valid routes or correctly identifies when no route exists.

    - Multiple restaurants at different distances.
    - Restaurants equidistant from Appleton Tower to test sorting consistency.
- **Validation**:
  - Validate that the sorting behaviour correctly orders the restaurants as expected.
  - Include edge cases, such as a single order or all restaurants being equidistant.

## General Observations

- A common set of synthetic test data will be generated once and reused across multiple requirements.
- Scaffolding will be developed iteratively, ensuring it is extensible to accommodate evolving requirements.
- All scaffolding components will include logging to enable detailed analysis of testing outcomes.

# Section 4: Evaluation of Instrumentation

The instrumentation required to test this project is extensive, given the complexity of the system and the critical importance of certain requirements. The primary form of instrumentation will involve the creation of synthetic test data, scaffolding to simulate various system behaviours, and logging mechanisms to capture test results.

## Synthetic Test Data

The project relies on dynamic data from the development server for its operations. However, testing must be independent of the server to ensure consistency and reliability. Therefore, a comprehensive set of synthetic test data will be created and maintained. This data will simulate real-world scenarios, including:

- Points near, inside, and at the boundaries of no-fly zones.
- Orders with varying restaurant locations and distances.
- Test cases for pathfinding, including direct routes, obstructed routes, and edge cases like identical start and end points.

By separating test data from the development server, the test suite remains stable even if the server data changes. This ensures reproducibility and allows for rigorous validation and verification of requirements.

## Reusability of Test Data

Test data generation is a repeated requirement across multiple tests, particularly for pathfinding and order validation. To optimise efficiency, test data will be generated once and reused across relevant tests. For example:

- Points and routes used in testing R1 (no-fly zones) will also be used for R2 (filtering invalid nodes).
- Synthetic orders generated for testing R5 (order sorting) will be reused in R3 and R4 to validate pathfinding and delivery routes.

This approach reduces redundancy and ensures consistency across different test scenarios.

## Limitations and Future Enhancements

While the current instrumentation provides a robust foundation, certain improvements could enhance testing efficiency and coverage:

- **Local Test Server**: Setting up a dedicated local test server to simulate the REST API would allow for more dynamic testing of API-dependent functionality without relying on synthetic data. However, this is not feasible within the project's current time constraints.
- **Advanced Logging**: Implementing a more sophisticated logging mechanism could provide deeper insights into test failures and system behaviour during tests. While basic logging will be used in this project, a more advanced solution could include detailed reporting and automated failure analysis.

## Integration of Instrumentation

All instrumentation components, including scaffolding and synthetic data, will be integrated into the test suite as reusable modules. This ensures that instrumentation can easily adapt to evolving requirements and new features.

In summary, the chosen instrumentation approach balances thoroughness and practicality, providing a reliable testing framework while allowing room for future enhancements.

# Section 5: Process and Risks

## 5.1 Process

The **PizzaDronz** project followed a waterfall development methodology, aligning with the requirements for detailed documentation and sequential stages of development. The test plan has been structured post-development, focusing on validating and verifying the existing functionalities rather than integrating iterative development cycles.

The identified test tasks were scheduled based on the dependencies between requirements and the resources required for validation. For instance:

- **Early Tasks**:

  - Generating synthetic test data for pathfinding, no-fly zones, and restaurant orders.
  - Building scaffolding for mocking pathfinding behaviours and simulating the drone's neighbour evaluation.

- **Mid-Phase Tasks**:

  - Integration testing to validate the interaction between the pathfinding algorithm, no-fly zone filtering, and order processing.
  - Verifying order sorting and ensuring valid routes for delivery.

- **Late-Phase Tasks**:
  - System testing to validate end-to-end functionality, including ensuring that the drone adheres to no-fly zone constraints and completes orders in ascending distance from Appleton Tower.
  - Validation of export outputs, such as GeoJSON and JSON files for flight paths and order details.

By aligning the test tasks with the waterfall stages, the critical components were validated early in the process, ensuring confidence in foundational elements like pathfinding and order validation. As the development progressed to higher levels, integration and system tests solidified the confidence in the overall system.

## 5.2 Risks

Several risks were identified in the testing and development lifecycle. These risks, along with their likelihood, potential impact, and mitigation strategies, are outlined below:

### 5.2.1 Synthetic Data Unrepresentativeness

- **Risk**: Synthetic test data may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios, leading to overconfidence in the system's performance.
- **Likelihood**: Moderate.
- **Impact**: High. If the test data fails to account for edge cases or typical orders, the drone may perform poorly in live operations.
- **Mitigation**: Create diverse and exhaustive test datasets, including:
  - Edge cases for no-fly zones (e.g., points near boundaries).
  - Randomised test data for longitude-latitude points across the central area.
  - Scenarios combining multiple constraints (e.g., tightly packed no-fly zones and close delivery deadlines).

### 5.2.2 Pathfinding Suboptimality

- **Risk**: The pathfinding algorithm may produce routes that are not near-optimal, affecting efficiency and battery usage.
- **Likelihood**: Low.
- **Impact**: Medium. While the heuristic used in A\* ensures admissibility and optimality, suboptimal scenarios could arise if implementation errors exist.
- **Mitigation**: Perform thorough unit testing of the pathfinding algorithm using various datasets. Focus on edge cases such as:
  - Routes with multiple obstacles (e.g., dense no-fly zones).
  - Points near the edges of the central area.

### 5.2.3 System Complexity

- **Risk**: As an integrated system, interactions between modules may lead to unforeseen bugs or performance issues.
- **Likelihood**: High.
- **Impact**: High. Bugs in integration could compromise the drone's ability to complete deliveries safely and efficiently.
- **Mitigation**: Conduct extensive integration tests before system-level tests. Use mocked components to simulate interactions and observe behaviours under controlled conditions.

### 5.2.4 Overdependence on Synthetic Testing

- **Risk**: Lack of real-world test data may lead to gaps in validation, particularly for edge cases not anticipated in synthetic datasets.
- **Likelihood**: Moderate.
- **Impact**: High.
- **Mitigation**: Incorporate real-world data if feasible or validate synthetic data against known benchmarks. Additionally, use logging and analytics from test executions to identify potential blind spots.

### 5.2.5 Export Data Validation

- **Risk**: Exported data, such as GeoJSON or JSON, may contain inaccuracies or fail to meet required formats.
- **Likelihood**: Low.
- **Impact**: Medium. Inaccurate exports could reduce system transparency and reliability.
- **Mitigation**: Validate all export outputs during system tests. Ensure format compliance and cross-reference data against test scenarios.

By addressing these risks through planned mitigations and aligning the testing process with the waterfall methodology, the project is well-positioned to meet its objectives and deliver a reliable, high-quality system.

# Section 6: Evaluation of Test Plan

The test plan for the **PizzaDronz** project effectively aligns with the waterfall methodology used during its development. By structuring the plan to prioritise early validation of critical components and progressively moving toward integration and system-level tests, we have ensured a systematic approach to testing. The following evaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of the test plan while reflecting on the processes, instrumentation, and risk management strategies employed.

## Strengths

1. **Alignment with Waterfall Methodology**:

   - The test plan’s sequential structure mirrors the waterfall process, ensuring that each stage builds on validated components from earlier stages.
   - Early validation of critical requirements, such as pathfinding and no-fly zone compliance, reduces the risk of cascading errors later in the lifecycle.

2. **Comprehensive Instrumentation**:

   - The use of synthetic test data across requirements ensures consistent and reliable testing, even in the absence of live server data.
   - Mocked components and scaffolding allow for detailed observation of behaviours, particularly in neighbour filtering and pathfinding algorithms.
   - Shared datasets for overlapping requirements improve efficiency and consistency in validation tasks.

3. **Focus on Critical Requirements**:

   - High-priority requirements, such as avoiding no-fly zones and ensuring valid paths between points, were given significant attention, with detailed tasks and validation strategies.
   - Edge case analysis and diverse test scenarios strengthen confidence in the robustness of the implementation.

4. **Risk Mitigation**:
   - Identified risks, such as synthetic data unrepresentativeness and system complexity, were addressed with practical mitigations, including the generation of diverse datasets and detailed integration testing.
   - Iterative testing tasks, such as route validation and neighbour filtering, minimise the likelihood of undetected issues.

## Limitations

1. **Reliance on Synthetic Data**:

   - While synthetic data provides a robust basis for testing, it may not fully represent real-world scenarios. This could leave gaps in the validation of edge cases or unexpected behaviours in live operations.

2. **Complexity of Pathfinding Validation**:

   - It is computationally expensive to determine the optimality of paths generated by the algorithm. While the heuristic has been mathematically proven admissible, practical validation relies on indirect measures, such as adherence to constraints and successful delivery completion.

3. **Late System-Level Testing**:

   - System tests, being the final stage of the plan, may reveal integration issues late in the process, potentially increasing the cost of fixes. However, the bottom-up approach mitigates this risk to some extent by ensuring component and integration reliability.

4. **Documentation and Time Constraints**:
   - The detailed documentation required for this coursework limits the flexibility to adopt iterative development approaches that might better accommodate changing requirements.

## Overall Effectiveness

The test plan provides a structured and well-considered approach to validating the **PizzaDronz** project. By focusing on critical requirements early, leveraging effective instrumentation, and addressing risks proactively, it ensures a high level of confidence in the final product’s quality and reliability. While limitations exist, such as reliance on synthetic data and the challenges of validating pathfinding optimality, the mitigations and planned strategies effectively address these concerns. The plan demonstrates a strong alignment with project goals and serves as a solid foundation for ensuring the system meets stakeholder expectations.
